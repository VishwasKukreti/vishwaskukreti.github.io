I am a doctoral student at ETC Labs, School of Computational & Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University. My research interest lie in the dynamics of complex system, especially, behaviour of complex socio-economic systems during phase transitions. I spend considerable amount of my time on BI/ML problems as a side project.
