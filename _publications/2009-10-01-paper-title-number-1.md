excerpt: 'We construct a complex network of global terrorism and study its growth dynamics, along with the statistical properties of the anti-social network. We use a disparity filter method to isolate backbone of the network, and identify the terror hubs and vulnerable motifs of global terrorism. We study the network resilience against targeted attacks and random failures, which could guide the counter-terrorist outfits in designing strategies to fight terrorism.'
