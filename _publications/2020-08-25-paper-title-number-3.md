excerpt: 'In this mini-review, we critically examine the recent work done on correlation-based networks in financial systems. The structure of empirical correlation matrices constructed from the financial market data changes as the individual stock prices fluctuate with time, showing interesting evolutionary patterns, especially during critical events such as market crashes, bubbles, etc. We show that the study of correlation-based networks and their evolution with time is useful for extracting important information of the underlying market dynamics. Also, we present our perspective on the use of recently-developed entropy measures, such as structural entropy and eigen-entropy, for continuous monitoring of correlation-based networks.'
